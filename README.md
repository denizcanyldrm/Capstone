# Capstone
Udacity Capstone Project

## Installation:
Necessary libraries to work with the project are:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- pickle
- python version 3

## Project Motivation:
In this project, I try to create customer segmentation report by using data provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. In this analysis, I have a chance to use 
some preprocessing techniques, unsupervised learning methods like PCA and K-Means Clustering and supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP).

## File Descriptions:
- 'Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb': displays all the work done
- 'helper.py': contains helper functions used in jupyter notebook
- README.md


## Results and Findings:
The performance of Gradient Boosting Classifier in the Kaggle Competition is roc_auc_score = 0.78864.
